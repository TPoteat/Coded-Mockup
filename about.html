      <p>This website was created as a final project in my Digtial Media 2 class. We were required to include to multiple techniques and skills we had learned with Html5 and css. We also had to include the following: 2 working animations/transitions, properly working fonts, all content remaining under 2mb, and making sure our index page, which is the most important page, drew the most attention. With all of these properties of our websites complete, we had finalized our website's designs. For my particular design, I created 5 separate web pages which consisted of my home, about, contact, gallery and portfolio pages. Besides my home page, the other four pages have a similar design format. This was the outline of my coded mockup so following that made applying my model to web design that more easier.
        The actual content is composed of various digital and traditional works I have created over the extent of my 3 years in high school. I have also included some artwork prior to high school for a comparison of how I have developed my skills and techinques at Cab Calloway. On my gallery page, I have included four different gallery slideshows...

           <center><p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p></center>
