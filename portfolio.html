        <div class="main">
           <center><p class="info">All of these artworks are potential candidates that I will possibly use as inspiration for my final art portfolio. The works below range from traditional artwork and paintings to digital designs and photograph. They are also pieces that span all across my three years of high school, where I was able to enhance my artist skills. In addition, I like the certain themes each piece displays such as in my 'Space' artwork and my altered photograph, 'Rotating Reflection'. Both works give off a different feeling and meaning, which is what I wish to fully convey in my final art portfoilo. </p></center>

      <p>This digital work was created using the multiple tools and techinques photoshop has to offer. I chose to use the 'cool' colors in favor for warmer colors because I likes how well the colors blended into the background. </p>
