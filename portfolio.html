        <center><h2>PORTFOLIO</h2></center>

<center>
        <div class="main">
           <center><p class="info">All of these artworks are potential candidates that I will possibly use as inspiration for my final art portfolio. The works below range from traditional artwork and paintings to digital designs and photograph. They are also pieces that span all across my three years of high school, where I was able to enhance my artist skills. In addition, I like the certain themes each piece displays such as in my 'Space' artwork and my altered photograph, 'Rotating Reflection'. Both works give off a different feeling and meaning, which is what I wish to fully convey in my final art portfoilo. </p></center>

      <h3>Banded Marbles</h3>
      <p>Banded Marbles was an artwork I created with color pencils in my Visual Arts Foundations 2 class. Our objective was to duplicate multiple objects disappearing into space using any one of the design perspectives.</p>

      <h3>Building Blocks</h3>
      <p>This piece was apart of a project from my Visual Arts Foundations 2 class. First, we designed multiple thumbnails of our compositions before we choose a sketch to incorprate into our final piece.</p>

      <h3>Bite</h3>
      <p>Unlike the other works featured here, this piece is from my 9th grade Visual Arts class. Our project restrictions required us to create an arrangement using hands as our primary focal point.  </p>

      <h3>New Space</h3>
      <p>This digital work was created using the multiple tools and techinques photoshop has to offer. I chose to use the 'cool' colors in favor for warmer colors because I likes how well the colors blended into the background. </p>

        <h3>Tint</h3>
      <p>This photograph is personally one of my favorites since I didn't have to edit the original image. The setting, taken in my living room after it had rained, displays an orange tinted-glow illuminating the room.</p>

      <h3>Christmas Special</h3>
        <p>For our Holiday Magazine in my Digial Media 2 class, we were each given pages to design. The title of my section was called, "Holidays Influencing Music" So, I created multiple compositions combining the holidays and music.</p>

      <h3>Nature Photograph</h3>
      <p>Nature photographs have always been one of my favorites as, most often, the composition is already set up for you. As I took this photo I attempted to incorporate the Rule-of-Thirds while arranging my the photograph.</p>
